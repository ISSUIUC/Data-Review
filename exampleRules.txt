TH 0 - 10.4 s < 3 s > 2 s = NA
checks from 0-10.4 seconds if s(sample) less than 3 greater than 2

CP 0 - 10.4 s < sn s > na s = NA
CP 0 - 10.4 s < NA s > NA s = 1 / 3 * sn
CP 0 - 10.4 s < NA s > sn / 3 s = NA

checks from 0 - 10.4 seconds  1 is s(sample) less than sn(next sample)  2 is s = 1/3 sn 3 is s greater than sn / 3

EN 0 - 10.4 s in std_dev
checks from 0 - 10.4 seconds s(sample) within 1 deviation of mean
